## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `v2_thresholds` setting for more flexible threshold configuration.
- Added `v2_critera` setting for more flexible and robust criteria configuration.
- Added update providers for easier (and slightly more secure) setup

### Changed

- Reduced amount of data stored in the state file (Yay for smaller file size).
- Criteria and threshold settings will now be considered on every run, even when the cache can be used.
- Some internals have been refactored. The result is more flexible, but also more readable code.
- Updated dependencies.
- Simplified configuration loading:
    * No more nested dicts 󱁖
    * More idiomatic use of pydantic models
- Renamed `critical` criterion to `pattern`
- Improved loading of custom criteria:
    * Check for `is_fulfilled` method on load
    * Fail if custom criteria directory is world-writable 󰒃

### Removed

- Removed the `i3status` output format - similar results can be achieved with the `custom` output format.
- `thresholds` field from configuration - use `v2_thresholds` instead.
- `criteria` field from configuration - use `v2_criteria` instead.
- `cmd_available` field from configuration - use `update_provider` instead.
